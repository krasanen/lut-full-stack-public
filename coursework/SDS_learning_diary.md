#### LEARNING DIARY ####

18.11.2022
Started getting familiar with the platform used to learn. Logged in to moodle, made public bitbucket
repository, and started to get familiar with Full-Stack course. Started watching Node.js Crash Course video.

19.11.2022
Finished with Node.js Crash Course video, eager to get my hands on, but trying to hold the horses
and get the basics learned properly. Been used to Android Studio but choosing VS Code as my editor
as it seems to fit better with Node.js. SourceTree seems not to have Linux version,
so skipping that optional tool. Starting getting familiar with MongoDB.

20.11.2022
Continued with MongoDB, installed it into own Linux Ubuntu machine and did trials with
the command line. Also installed Compass to see databases. Having been used to relational databases,
this looks very promising! Started ExpressJS course and followed it by coding the same thing alongside.

2.12.2022
Refreshed course goals and got an idea to change old PHP based implementation of my website
https://zmengames.com into using MERN stack. It could be the final exercise of the course for me.
Asked from the course directors if it is ok, and it was. Everything else than the actual website
will be public on this repository.
